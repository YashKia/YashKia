I’m a third-year postdoctoral researcher at Emory University, working with Dr. Gari Clifford. My research lies at the crossroads of biomedical sensing and AI, where I lead projects aimed at tackling critical challenges like predicting high-risk behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and assessing cognitive health in elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). For the ASD project, I'm developing explainable AI models that use off-body sleep analysis to predict risky behaviors and medical events. I was fortunate to receive the Thrasher Research Early Career Award, which funds my work on the connection between sleep and daytime behavior in ASD. On the MCI side, I’m collaborating with NextSense Inc. and Emory’s Goizueta Brain Health Institute to integrate data from in-ear EEG, wristband monitors, and social interactions to better understand and assess cognitive status. I earned my PhD from Georgia Tech, where I focused on creating AI-driven algorithms in Nanophotonics, leading to breakthroughs like neuro-inspired computing frameworks and nanoscale sensors. Throughout my career, I've published research, mentored students, and worked on bringing innovative solutions from theory to practice in both healthcare and engineering.
