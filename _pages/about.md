My research focuses on developing AI-driven methods for health and healthcare, with an emphasis on innovative sensing technologies to uncover physiological and psychological patterns. These tools are designed to enable early detection and intervention, advancing personalized care and improving outcomes. 

Over the past three years, I have focused on exploring novel biomarkers for neurological disorders through wearable and nearable technologies. In collaboration with the [Cognitive Empowerment Program](https://empowerment.emory.edu) and [Goizueta Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Research Center](https://alzheimers.emory.edu), I am exploring novel metrics to identify cognitive markers in elderly individuals at risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment. This research integrates data from cutting-edge [NextSense in-ear EEG devices](https://www.nextsense.io), wristband health monitors, and analyses of movement patterns and social interactions to better assess cognitive status. Additionally, I collaborate with [The Center for Discovery](https://thecenterfordiscovery.org) in New York to model the relationship between sleep and daytime behaviors in children with autism. This study involves building an end-to-end edge computing pipeline using off-body sensing technologies in privacy-preserving settings to understand how sleep influences daytime activity and overall health.

Before starting my postdoctoral research at [Emory](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), I earned my PhD from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu). During my PhD, I introduced new approaches for knowledge discovery in nanophotonics through dimensionality reduction. My research accelerated the design of nanoscale sensors by utilizing artificial intelligence to better understand nuanced patterns in light-matter interaction.

My long-term goal is to pioneer the discovery of novel health biomarkers through cutting-edge wearable technologies, building upon the work featured in my recent publications as a foundation for the next phase of my career.
