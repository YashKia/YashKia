I primarily research AI-driven approaches for health and healthcare, focusing on developing innovative sensing pipelines to detect underlying physiological and psychological patterns for early intervention. My work lies at the intersection of machine learning, biomedical sensing, and health monitoring, aiming to enhance diagnostic and therapeutic tools.  


Over the past three years, I have focused on exploring novel biomarkers for neurological disorders through wearable and nearable technologies. In collaboration with the [Cognitive Empowerment Program](https://empowerment.emory.edu) and [Goizueta Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Research Center](https://alzheimers.emory.edu), I am exploring novel metrics to identify cognitive markers in elderly individuals at risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment. This research integrates data from cutting-edge [NextSense in-ear EEG devices](https://www.nextsense.io), wristband health monitors, and analyses of movement patterns and social interactions to better assess cognitive status. Additionally, I collaborate with [The Center for Discovery](https://thecenterfordiscovery.org) in New York to model the relationship between sleep and daytime behaviors in children with autism. This project involves building comprehensive models using off-body sensing technologies to understand how sleep influences daytime activity and overall health.

Before starting my postdoctoral research at [Emory](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), I earned my PhD from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu). During my PhD, I introduced new approaches for knowledge discovery in nanophotonics through dimensionality reduction. My research accelerated the design of nanoscale sensors by integrating engineering principles with artificial intelligence.

My long-term goal is to pioneer the discovery of novel health biomarkers through cutting-edge wearable technologies, building upon the work featured in my recent publications as a foundation for the next phase of my career.
